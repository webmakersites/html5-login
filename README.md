   # HTML5 Login
- Add Users by creating folders in the `/user/` directory. The folder title is the username of this user.
	-	Each folder should contain `index.html` (where the password input is), `pw.html`(login pass page, repace `pw` with the user's password), and `logout.html` (logout url, displays a "You are logged out" message.
- How does it work?
	- HTML5 Login works with a series of redirects specified by text inputs.
- Here is a diagram of how everything is laid out
